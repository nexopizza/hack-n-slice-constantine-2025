# 🍕 Gamified Feedback Collection 

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

In hospitality environments, collecting customer feedback is essential—but often feels tedious or intrusive. Your challenge is to **design and prototype an engaging, gamified feedback system** that encourages users to share their experience in a fun, frictionless way. Think of it as turning feedback into a moment of delight.

The goal: **increase feedback volume and quality** while making the process feel like a playful interaction rather than a chore.

## 🧩 Objectives

Participants should:

- Design interactive feedback components such as:
  - Mini-quizzes (e.g. “What kind of pizza spirit are you?”)
  - Emoji sliders (e.g. drag a pizza slice from “meh” to “divine!”)
  - Tap-based reactions, animated buttons, or micro-games
- Ensure the system captures useful operational data (e.g. satisfaction, wait time, cleanliness, staff friendliness)
- Make it multilingual and culturally adaptable (especially French, Arabic, and English)
- Integrate visual storytelling or poetic branding (e.g. themed feedback tied to historical or seasonal events)
- Include backend logic or mock API to simulate data collection and analysis
- Consider user fatigue and accessibility — keep it lightweight, intuitive, and inclusive

## 🎮 Bonus Features (Optional but Encouraged)

- Reward systems (e.g. badges, coupons, leaderboard)
- AI-generated personalized feedback prompts
- Real-time dashboard for staff to view feedback trends
- Offline mode or QR-triggered feedback

## 🧠 Suggested Approach

### 1. User Journey Mapping
- Identify key touchpoints for feedback (e.g. post-order, checkout, after dining)
- Define user personas (e.g. solo diner, family, tourist) and tailor feedback formats accordingly

### 2. Gamification Strategy
- Use behavioral psychology principles (e.g. instant gratification, curiosity loops)
- Keep interactions short, visual, and rewarding
- Use humor, storytelling, or themed visuals to make feedback memorable

### 3. Data Design
- Define useful metrics (e.g. Net Promoter Score, sentiment, service ratings)
- Structure feedback data in JSON format for easy integration

2. Questions:
   - “Your ideal evening feels like…” (souks, gardens, taverns, workshops)
   - “How did our service feel today?” (swift, warm, tangled, rhythmic)
   - “What flavor would you chase next?” (lamb & fig, citrus mint, harissa & honey, tomato basil)
3. Result: “You are the Artisan Spirit — bold, curious, and full of fire!”  
   - Avatar + badge + optional social share  
   - Feedback stored behind the scenes

### 😋 Module 2: Emoji Slider — “Rate Your Flavor Journey”

**Slider Positions:**

| Slider Position | Emoji | Label             |
