# ðŸ“¦ Stock and Purchase Management System

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project involves designing a **mobile-friendly application for inventory and purchase management** for store managers. The system helps track stock levels, identify missing products, and generate a printable or shareable purchase list with quantities and suppliers information for each product.

Managers can use their mobile devices to:
- Check inventory levels
- Identify products below the minimum allowed quantity
- Add new products with relevant details
- Automatically generate a purchase list with supplier contact information

## ðŸ“± Key Features
- **Mobile-Friendly UI**: Optimized for smartphones and tablets
- **Inventory Tracking**: Manually update product quantities
- **Product Management**: Add/edit products with fields:
  - Name
  - Price
  - Unit (e.g., kg, liter, piece)
  - Supplier name and contact
  - Minimum allowed quantity
  - etc
- **Purchase List Generation**: Automatically compile a list of products below the threshold
- **Export Options**: Share or print the purchase list for procurement
