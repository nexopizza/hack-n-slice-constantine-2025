• 	Dietary preferences (vegetarian, chicken world, etc)
• 	Time of day (e.g. lighter meals at lunch, indulgent options at night)
• 	Budget sensitivity (e.g. show affordable options first)
• 	Dynamic layout: reorder or highlight items based on relevance to the user

### 2. Push Notifications & Smart Marketing
• 	Notify users of:
• 	New products tailored to their taste
• 	Personalized promotions (e.g. “Your favorite pizza is 15% off today!”)
