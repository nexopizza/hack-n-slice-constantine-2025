## 🎮 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Business Lunch
# Mid-budget, lunch time → professional options
context = Context(user_id=1, time_of_day="lunch", budget_level="mid")
recommendations = get_recommendations(user_id=1, context=context, top_k=5)
Expected: Professional, mid-budget lunch options suitable for business meetings.

### Scenario 2: Budget Dinner
# Low budget, evening → affordable comfort food
context = Context(user_id=2, time_of_day="dinner", budget_level="low")
recommendations = get_recommendations(user_id=2, context=context, top_k=8)
Expected: Affordable dinner options, comfort food, family-friendly.

### Scenario 3: Premium Morning
# High budget, morning → upscale breakfast
context = Context(user_id=3, time_of_day="morning", budget_level="high")
recommendations = get_recommendations(user_id=3, context=context, top_k=6)
Expected: Upscale breakfast items, premium coffee, gourmet options.

### Scenario 4: Dietary Restrictions
# Vegetarian, gluten-free options
user_query = "I want healthy vegetarian options with no gluten"
recommendations = smart_recommender.get_recommendations(
    user_id=4, 
    user_query=user_query, 
    include_explanation=True
)
Expected: Vegetarian, gluten-free options with clear explanations.

#  Smart Menu (Frontend Part)

- <img src="https://github.com/Anmol-Baranwal/Cool-GIFs-For-GitHub/assets/74038190/761f4c99-eda3-4c9a-a4ec-2b6311e2433a" width="75">&nbsp;\

**Smart Menu** is a demo project showcasing an AI-powered pizza recommendation system.  
The AI suggests pizzas in the "For You" section based on:

- Customer past purchases & favorites
- Optional allergy/preferences questionnaire

>  Coins/reward system idea is als  included (as an idea only) to motivate users, but its demo-only in this version.:D !!

---
### What we Implemented:

- **AI Demo:** Mocked recommendations in "For You" category
- **Questionnaire Pop-up:** Empty questions in frontend; backend fills content
- **Static Menu Demo:** Default to Veggie Pizza
- **Translations:** Active for questionnaire using `i18n.js`
- **Cart & Coins:** Demo visuals only

###  Frontend Contributions

- **Lemma Dorsaf Rofia:** Category bar, menu grid, login form & user slide & translations, `App.jsx`, styles
- **Ali Djerdi:** Navbar, card styling (not fully used due to dynamic content)

### Ideas / Not Yet Implemented/ it has the demo (not functional yet) 

- Coins/reward system
- Full AI integration with backend data
- Questionnaire fully functional for allergies/preferences
- Organized backend & dynamic menu content
- Polished user account area & separate pages

---
## Tech Stack

- **React.js**
- **TypeScript** (API calls)
- **CSS & TailwindCSS** (very minimal usage of tailwindcss)
- **Axios**
- **i18n.js** (translations)

---

### Testing Account

- **Username:** `test`
- **Password:** `test`

### Run the Demo

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
 
Link and run backend (Django):

python manage.py runserver


Start frontend:

npm start

---

⚠️ Without connecting to backend, menu grid won’t show real data. !!

!! Future Improvements :D

Separate frontend pages for better UX

Polished user account area

Coins/reward system fully implemented

Full AI integration

Dynamic questionnaire & backend integration
