# ‚è±Ô∏è Staff Clock-In & Out

## üéØ Project Objective
Provide a simple, reliable timekeeping system for Nexo Pizza team members to clock in/out and track breaks. Automatically compute daily, weekly, and monthly hours with overtime rules, and export approved timesheets to the payroll module.

---

## üß© Functional Requirements

### 1. üëã Clocking Actions
- Clock in, clock out, break start, break end
- Prevent duplicate/misordered punches; handle missed punches with supervisor correction + reason
- Kiosk-friendly web UI (PIN/QR), touch-first, fast feedback
- Optional device lock or geofencing; basic offline queue with automatic sync

### 2. üë• Employee & Roles
- Create employees with role, site/location, base pay rate, and schedule
- Role-based permissions: employee, supervisor/manager, admin
- Minimal PII; store only necessary identifiers

### 3. üßÆ Timesheet Calculation
- Totals by day/week/pay period (regular, overtime, unpaid/paid breaks)
- Overtime rules (e.g., >8h/day or >40h/week), rounding (e.g., 5/10/15-min), grace periods
- Cross-midnight shifts, time zone consistency, partial-day handling

### 4. ‚úÖ Review & Approval
- Supervisor review of edits and exceptions (missed punches, long breaks)
- Audit trail of manual adjustments (who, when, why)
- Lock approved periods to prevent further changes

### 5. üí∏ Payroll Export
- Generate export for `payroll-module` (JSON) and optional CSV
- Include per-employee totals per period (regular, OT, breaks) with metadata

### 6. üìä Dashboard & Reports
- Who‚Äôs currently on shift, late/missed punches, daily/weekly totals
- Filter by location/role/date; export to CSV

### 7. üîê Security & Compliance
- Authentication and role-based authorization
- Protect sensitive data; avoid storing raw biometric data
- Retain audit logs for changes and approvals

## üß† Suggested Approach

### Step-by-Step Guide
1. Define data models: Punch, TimesheetDay, PayPeriod, Employee, Approval
2. Build API endpoints for punch create/list, timesheet compute, approve/lock, export
3. Implement kiosk UI: PIN/QR login, 1-tap punch, error/duplicate prevention
4. Add authentication/authorization and audit logging
5. Implement calculation engine: rounding, overtime, cross-midnight handling
6. Add exceptions workflow and supervisor approvals
7. Generate payroll exports and basic reports/dashboard

---

## üéì Learning Objectives
- Design and implement timekeeping workflows end-to-end
- Build a calculation engine with rounding and overtime rules
- Apply secure auth, RBAC, and audit trails
- Produce operational dashboards and compliant exports

---

## üí° Optional Enhancements
- Face/QR verification, geofencing, and device binding
- Offline-first kiosk with background sync and conflict resolution
- Shift scheduling, tardiness alerts, and PTO/leave requests
- Multi-location rollups and anomaly detection (time theft, duplicate devices)
