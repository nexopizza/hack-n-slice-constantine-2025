# ‚è±Ô∏è Staff Clock-In & Out (Lite)

## üéØ Project Objective
A minimal time tracker for team members to clock in/out (with an optional single break) and compute basic daily/weekly hours, with a simple export for payroll.

---

## üß© Minimal Features

- Clock in and clock out
- Optional: start/end one unpaid break per shift
- See today‚Äôs status and totals (day/week)
- Simple JSON export of total hours per employee and period for the payroll module

Non‚Äëgoals (not included): approvals, audit logs, overtime rules, geofencing, device binding, offline mode, dashboards.

## üß™ Sample Data

### Punch Event
```json
{
  "employee_id": "emp_00123",
  "action": "clock_in",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-29T08:57:12Z"
}
```

### Daily Summary
```json
{
  "employee_id": "emp_00123",
  "date": "2025-08-29",
  "punches": [
    { "in": "2025-08-29T09:00:00Z", "out": "2025-08-29T13:00:00Z" },
    { "in": "2025-08-29T14:00:00Z", "out": "2025-08-29T18:00:00Z" }
  ],
  "break": { "start": "2025-08-29T13:00:00Z", "end": "2025-08-29T14:00:00Z" },
  "worked_hours": 8.0
}
```

### Payroll Export (very simple)
```json
{
  "period": { "start": "2025-08-18", "end": "2025-08-31" },
  "employees": [
    { "employee_id": "emp_00123", "total_hours": 80.0 }
  ]
}
```

## üß† Suggested Approach (Lite)

1. Data model: Punch, DailySummary, PayPeriodTotals
2. Endpoints: create punch, list punches, compute summaries, export totals
3. UI: simple page with one button (in/out toggle) and an optional break button
4. Keep times in UTC; assume shifts end the same day
